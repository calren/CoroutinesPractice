# CoroutinesPractice

This is a small project to practice using coroutines.

1. Clone this project and import it into Android Studio
2. Run the app on your device / emulator
3. Notice that there are two buttons: One to show a toast, and one to start a 5 second timer.
  a. When you start the 5 second timer, notice that you can no longer click the button to show the toast.
4. Your goal is to use Coroutines so that users can start the timer and still be able to click the button to show the toast.
